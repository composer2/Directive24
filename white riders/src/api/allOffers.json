The board arrived fast and it was actually a pretty good board. Granted, as some of the other reviews mentioned, this is a plastic board and so the edges aren't that sharp but, we're not using it on a ski slope. We have a nice area near our house that has hills about 25 feet high so, this was perfect. The board was sturdy, it allowed him to attach to and get out of the bindings easily and most of all, he loved it and he ended up being pretty impressive on it. For fifty dollars, this was great buy for a beginning boarder."
